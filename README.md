Pre-requisites


Android Studio 3.0 or later and you know how to use it.


Make sure Android Studio is updated, as well as your SDK and Gradle.
Otherwise, you may have to wait for a while until all the updates are done.


A device or emulator that runs SDK level 21


You need to be solidly familiar with the Java programming language,
object-oriented design concepts, and Android Development Fundamentals.
In particular:

RecyclerView and Adapters
SQLite database and the SQLite query language
Threading and ExecutorService
It helps to be familiar with software architectural patterns that separate
data from the user interface, such as MVP or MVC. This codelab implements the
architecture defined in the
Guide to App Architecture



Getting Started


Install Android Studio,
